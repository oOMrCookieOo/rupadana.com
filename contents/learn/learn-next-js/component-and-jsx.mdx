## What is Component?

The simple mean of Component is **The Function that return HTML**

```jsx
const Button = () => <button>Click Me</button>;
```

## What is JSX?

JSX (JavaScript XML) is syntax extension that allow you writing component in React/Next

## Component in Next js

We have 2 Component in Next js, Client and Server Component. By default, all component in Next js is Server Component

```jsx
// This will be server component
const Button = () => <button>Click Me</button>;
```

So, how to create client component? Its simple! Just add "use client" on the top of page

```jsx
'use client';

// This will be client component
const Button = () => <button>Click Me</button>;
```

Fyi, server component is only exist in Next js. So we havn't server component in React js

See full documentation about [Server Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) and [Client Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components)
