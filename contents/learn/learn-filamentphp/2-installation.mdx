> Requirements

Filament requires the following to run:

- PHP 8.1+
- [Laravel v10.0+](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x)
- [Livewire v3.0+](https://livewire.laravel.com)

> Installation

Install the Filament Panel Builder by running the following commands in your Laravel project directory:

```bash
composer require filament/filament:"^3.0-stable" -W

php artisan filament:install --panels
```

This will create and register a new [Laravel service provider](https://laravel.com/docs/providers) called `app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php`.

> Migration

Setup your database and run Migration

```bash
php artisan migrate
```


> Create a user

You can create a new user account with the following command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-user
```

Open `/admin` in your web browser, sign in, and start building your app!
