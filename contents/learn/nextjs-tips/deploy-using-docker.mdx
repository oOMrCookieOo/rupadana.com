> Introduction

In this post im using `next@14.3.12`, it maybe will be different method in the future.

> Creating a Next.js app

In this post, we will work with a basic next js app generated when you run the command:

```
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-docker-app
```

Run the development server using the command npm run dev which should give an output that the server is running on localhost:3000. When you open your browser on the provided URL.

> Writing a Dockerfile

Docker, in a nutshell, allows developers to simply generate, distribute, and deploy images, resulting in faster development cycles and simpler application management.

With that stated, let's create a file named, `Dockerfile` in our root directory and paste the following content within it.

```
FROM node:18-alpine as builder
WORKDIR /my-space

COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:18-alpine as runner
WORKDIR /my-space
COPY --from=builder /my-space/package.json .
COPY --from=builder /my-space/package-lock.json .
COPY --from=builder /my-space/next.config.js ./
COPY --from=builder /my-space/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /my-space/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder /my-space/.next/static ./.next/static
EXPOSE 3000
ENTRYPOINT ["npm", "start"]

```

> Optimize Nextjs for Production

## Edit next.config.js

Edit your `next.config.js`, it will be generate `.next/standalone`.

During `next build`, Next.js will use [@vercel/nft](https://github.com/vercel/nft) to statically analyze `import`, `require`, and `fs` usage to determine all files that a page might load.

Next.js' production server is also traced for its needed files and output at `.next/next-server.js.nft.json` which can be leveraged in production.

To leverage the `.nft.json` files emitted to the `.next` output directory, you can read the list of files in each trace that are relative to the `.nft.json` file and then copy them to your deployment location.


```
const nextConfig = {
    ...
    output: 'standalone',
    ...
}
```


## Add `sharp` module

```
npm i sharp
```

```
yarn add sharp
```

```
pnpm add sharp
```

```
bun add sharp
```

## Update `start` script

To optimize image size, in the `standalone` directory do not install the `next` module, and we cannot run `next start`. We have to run it using `node`.

update your `package.json`

```
{
    "scripts" : {
        "start": "node server.js",
    }
}
```

> Build Docker Images

```
docker build -t rupadana/rupadana.com ./
```

> Run app

```
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 rupadana/rupadana.com
```

Finally, it will be hosted on http://localhost:3000
